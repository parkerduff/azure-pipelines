# Shared CI Platform — Enterprise Pipeline Repository

This repository contains the shared CI/CD platform configuration for the organization.
It includes build templates, release workflows, helper scripts, and service pipeline
definitions used across all engineering teams.

> **Note**: This repository has evolved organically over several years and contains
> significant technical debt including template drift, duplicate logic, and non-build
> workloads running on CI infrastructure.

## Template Architecture

Templates are organized into several areas:

- **Central templates** (`templates/build/`, `templates/test/`, `templates/release/`) — canonical shared templates maintained by the shared-ci-platform team
- **Language setup** (`templates/language/`) — language-specific environment setup
- **Legacy templates** (`templates/legacy/`) — older template versions still in use
- **Alternative templates** (`alt-templates/`) — team-maintained forks for specialized needs
- **Build tool helpers** (`build-tools/yaml/`) — shared YAML fragments

## Branch Model

Templates are consumed via branch references. Multiple long-lived branches exist
with divergent template logic:

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Canonical shared templates |
| `master` | Legacy default branch (pre-rename) |
| `staging/preprod` | Staging environment modifications |
| `staging/release-hardening` | Release workflow hardening |
| `team/frontend-custom` | Frontend team customizations |
| `team/quant-experiments` | Quant team experimental changes |
| `team/reporting-hotfix` | Compliance workflow patches |
| `legacy/master-support` | Frozen compatibility branch |

See [docs/branch-usage-notes.md](docs/branch-usage-notes.md) for details.

## Services

| Service | Stack | Template Source |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| pricing-engine | .NET | central templates |
| portfolio-api | Java/Maven | central templates (master) |
| risk-batch | Python | central templates (staging/preprod) |
| market-sim | Rust | custom (inline) |
| ops-control-plane | Go | custom (inline) |
| frontend-workbench | Node/React | alt-templates (team/frontend-custom) |
| regulatory-reporting | Python | hybrid (team-overrides + central) |
| notebook-executor | Python | none (non-build workload) |
| scenario-runner | Python | none (non-build workload) |
